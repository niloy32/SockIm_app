Hello,I managed to add every feature except the database part.
I didn't use any framework or bootstrap components.
please download the zip and run the server.js file with node to start the app. 
The default port is set to 3500.
I have also hosted the app on heroku and didn't use any Firebase
or any integrated platform to create the app.
Please use 2 different Browsers or Incognito mode to log into 2 different users


App Link to Heroku- https://sockim.herokuapp.com/
